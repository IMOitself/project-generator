# project-generator
This is my personal project generator for creating android apps.

To prevent getting burnout, <br>
I will not gonna be configuring this to...
- be easy to understand for non android developers 
- support IDEs (like Android Studio) other than AIDE,
- support for other android versions. the permission logic and stuffs is hard to babysit,
- support androidx, appcompat, compose
- support java 8 or above.

soon i guess, idk.
